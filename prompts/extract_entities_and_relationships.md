# Instructions
1. Identify key entities (people, places, concepts, objects, events) from the text.
2. For each entity, provide a brief description.
3. Identify relationships between entities.
4. Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Entity Name",
      "description": "Brief description of the entity",
      "categories": ["Category1", "Category2"]
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "Source Entity Name",
      "target": "Target Entity Name",
      "type": "relationship_type",
      "properties": {
        "property1": "value1",
        "property2": "value2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# Guidelines
- Entity names should be concise and specific
- Descriptions should be factual and informative
- Relationship types should be in snake_case (e.g., "worked_with", "located_in")
- Include relevant properties for relationships when available
- Categories should help classify the entity (e.g., "Person", "Organization", "Concept")
- Ensure all entities referenced in relationships are defined in the entities list
