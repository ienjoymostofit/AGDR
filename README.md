# Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning

This repository contains an implementation inspired by concepts from ["Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13025) by [Markus J. Buehler](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4173-9659). This implementation focuses on core concepts of iterative knowledge graph expansion through language model-driven reasoning.

## üìù Scope Note

This is an implementation that focuses on basic autonomous knowledge graph expansion and implements core concepts of iterative reasoning and structured knowledge extraction. It provides a practical starting point for experimenting with agentic knowledge graphs.

Key characteristics:
- Focuses on autonomous knowledge graph expansion
- Implements iterative reasoning and structured knowledge extraction
- Provides a practical starting point

## üåü Key Features

- **Iterative Graph Expansion**: Grows knowledge graphs through recursive reasoning.
- **Multi-Model Architecture**: Separates reasoning and entity extraction tasks using configurable models.
- **Neo4j Integration**: Persistent storage and querying of the generated knowledge graph.
- **Streaming Output**: Real-time visualization of the reasoning process.
- **Flexible Model Configuration**: Supports different LLM providers through configurable API endpoints.
- **Embedding support**: Implements vector embedding for text comparison.

## Examples

**Prompt:** "Describe the role and stance of Sweden during World War II"
**Iterations:** 2

## üîß Technical Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Reasoning Engine**: Generates detailed reasoning traces about a given topic using a configured language model.
2. **Knowledge Extractor**: Converts unstructured reasoning into graph-structured data (entities and relationships).
3. **Graph Manager**: Handles Neo4j database operations, including creating nodes and relationships.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for Neo4j)
- Access to OpenAI API or a compatible LLM API endpoint (e.g., Ollama).
- Access to a local LLM API endpoint (e.g., Ollama) is recommended for faster iteration, especially for the reasoning and embedding models.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-deep-graph-reasoning.git
cd agentic-deep-graph-reasoning
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start Neo4j:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:

```env
# Neo4j Configuration
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=testtest

# Reasoning Model Configuration
REASONING_MODEL_CONFIG='{"model_name": "openthinker:7b-q8_0", "api_key": "dummy", "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1/"}'

# Entity Extraction Model Configuration
ENTITY_EXTRACTION_MODEL_CONFIG='{"model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "api_key": "sk---", "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/"}'

# Embedding Model Configuration
EMBEDDING_MODEL_CONFIG='{"model_name": "granite-embedding:30m-en-fp16", "api_key": "dummy", "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1/"}'

# Reasoning Tag Configuration.  These tags are used to extract the reasoning trace from the LLM output.
# For deepscaler models:
#THINK_TAGS="[\"<think>\",\"</think>\"]"
# For openthinker models:
THINK_TAGS="[\"<|begin_of_thought|>\",\"<|end_of_thought|>\"]"
```

#### Model Configuration Options

- For OpenAI models:
  - `base_url`: "https://api.openai.com/v1/"
  - `model_name`: "gpt-4", "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4o-mini", etc.
  - `api_key`: Your OpenAI API key.

- For local models (e.g., Ollama):
  - `base_url`: "http://localhost:11434/v1/"
  - `model_name`: The name of the model you have pulled from Ollama (e.g., "llama2", "mistral", "openthinker:7b-q8_0", "granite-embedding:30m-en-fp16", etc.).
  - `api_key`:  A dummy value like "dummy" can be used.

**Important notes on model configuration:**

*   The `REASONING_MODEL_CONFIG` and `ENTITY_EXTRACTION_MODEL_CONFIG` settings define which models are used for reasoning and entity extraction, respectively. You can use different models for these tasks.
*   The `EMBEDDING_MODEL_CONFIG` specifies the model used for generating text embeddings.
*   Different models may require different reasoning tag formats. Ensure that the `THINK_TAGS` setting is correctly configured to match the output format of your reasoning model. Refer to the model's documentation for the correct tags. Some example configurations are provided in the `.env.example` file.

### Reasoning Trace Format

This implementation expects the reasoning model to output its reasoning within the tags specified in the `THINK_TAGS` environment variable. This format is particularly suited for models that are trained to provide structured reasoning traces.

Example expected output for `openthinker:7b-q8_0`:
```
<|begin_of_thought|>
Okay, so I need to figure out the ...
Now, thinking about ...
<|end_of_thought|>
```

When using custom models or different LLM providers, ensure they:
1.  Always wrap reasoning in the configured tags.
2.  Provide structured, step-by-step reasoning.
3.  End the reasoning trace with the closing tag.

The system uses these tags to properly parse and process the reasoning trace for knowledge extraction. If your model doesn't natively support this format, you may need to modify the system prompt or post-process the output.

### Running the Application

Run the knowledge graph generation with:
```bash
python src/application.py "Your initial prompt" <number-of-iterations>
```

Example:
```bash
python src/application.py "Describe a way to design impact resistant materials" 3
```

## üìñ Example Prompts

- "Describe a way to design impact resistant materials"
- "Describe the role and stance of Sweden during World War II"
- "Explain how photosynthesis works in plants"

## üéØ Core Innovation

Unlike traditional knowledge graph systems, this implementation follows an agentic approach where the system:

- Autonomously determines what knowledge to expand.
- Maintains contextual awareness across iterations.
- Structures knowledge organically through reasoning.

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

- Check Neo4j browser interface at `http://localhost:7474`
- View logging output in real-time during execution in the console.
- Monitor entity and relationship creation in the console output.
- Examine the generated knowledge graph in Neo4j to verify the accuracy and completeness of the extracted information.
