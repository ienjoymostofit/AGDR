## üîß Technical Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1.  **Reasoning Service**: Generates detailed reasoning traces about a given topic using a configured language model.
2.  **Knowledge Extractor Service**: Converts unstructured reasoning into graph-structured data (entities and relationships) based on a defined prompt.
3.  **Graph Population Service**: Handles Neo4j database operations, including creating nodes and relationships, and manages potential conflicts.
4.  **Embedding Service**: Provides vector embeddings for entities, enabling similarity searches and conflict resolution.
5.  **Conflict Resolution Service**: Resolves conflicts between existing and new entities using an LLM.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for Neo4j and pgvector)
- Access to OpenAI API or a compatible LLM API endpoint (e.g., Ollama).
- A running PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension enabled.
- Access to a local LLM API endpoint (e.g., Ollama) is recommended for faster iteration, especially for the reasoning and embedding models.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-deep-graph-reasoning.git
cd agentic-deep-graph-reasoning
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start Neo4j and pgvector using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d   # Only start Neo4j
```

4.  **Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector:**

    *   If you don't have a PostgreSQL instance, you can use Docker:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d postgres
        ```

    *   Connect to the PostgreSQL instance (e.g., using `psql`):

        ```bash
        psql -h localhost -P54321 -U postgres -d postgres
        ```

    *   Create the `pgvector` extension:

        ```sql
        CREATE EXTENSION vector;
        ```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:

```env
# Neo4j Configuration

NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=testtest

# Reasoning Model Configuration
REASONING_MODEL_CONFIG='{"model_name": "openthinker:7b-q8_0", "api_key": "dummy", "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1/", "prefix_message": ""}'

# Entity Extraction Model Configuration
ENTITY_EXTRACTION_MODEL_CONFIG='{"model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "api_key": "sk---", "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/", "prefix_message": ""}'

# Embedding Model Configuration

# Reasoning Tag Configuration.  These tags are used to extract the reasoning trace from the LLM output.
# For deepscaler models:
#THINK_TAGS="[\"<think>\",\"</think>\"]"
# For openthinker models:
THINK_TAGS="[\"<|begin_of_thought|>\",\"<|end_of_thought|>\"]"

#### Model Configuration Options

- For OpenAI models:
  - `base_url`: "https://api.openai.com/v1/"
  - `model_name`: "gpt-4", "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4o-mini", etc.
  - `api_key`: Your OpenAI API key.
  - `prefix_message`: Optional message to prepend to the prompt.

- For local models (e.g., Ollama):
  - `base_url`: "http://localhost:11434/v1/"
  - `model_name`: The name of the model you have pulled from Ollama (e.g., "llama2", "mistral", "openthinker:7b-q8_0", "granite-embedding:30m-en-fp16", etc.).
  - `api_key`:  A dummy value like "dummy" can be used.
  - `prefix_message`: Optional message to prepend to the prompt.

**Important notes on model configuration:**

*   The `REASONING_MODEL_CONFIG`, `ENTITY_EXTRACTION_MODEL_CONFIG`, and `CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_MODEL_CONFIG` settings define which models are used for reasoning, entity extraction, and conflict resolution, respectively. You can use different models for these tasks.
*   The `EMBEDDING_MODEL_CONFIG` specifies the model used for generating text embeddings.
*   Different models may require different reasoning tag formats. Ensure that the `THINK_TAGS` setting is correctly configured to match the output format of your reasoning model. Refer to the model's documentation for the correct tags. Some example configurations are provided in the `.env.example` file.
*   The `prefix_message` field in the model configurations allows you to prepend a message to the prompt. This can be useful for models that require a specific prefix to function correctly.

### Reasoning Trace Format

This implementation expects the reasoning model to output its reasoning within the tags specified in the `THINK_TAGS` environment variable. This format is particularly suited for models that are trained to provide structured reasoning traces.

Example expected output for `openthinker:7b-q8_0`:
```
<|begin_of_thought|>
Okay, so I need to figure out the ...
Now, thinking about ...
<|end_of_thought|>
```

When using custom models or different LLM providers, ensure they:
1.  Always wrap reasoning in the configured tags.
2.  Provide structured, step-by-step reasoning.
3.  End the reasoning trace with the closing tag.

The system uses these tags to properly parse and process the reasoning trace for knowledge extraction. If your model doesn't natively support this format, you may need to modify the system prompt or post-process the output.

### Running the Application

Run the knowledge graph generation with:
```bash
python src/application.py "Your initial prompt" <number-of-iterations>
```

Example:
```bash
python src/application.py "Describe a way to design impact resistant materials" 3
```

## üìñ Example Prompts

- "Describe a way to design impact resistant materials"
- "Describe the role and stance of Sweden during World War II"
- "Explain how photosynthesis works in plants"

## ‚öôÔ∏è Utilities

The `utilities` directory contains helpful scripts:

*   `extract_to_dot.py`: Exports the knowledge graph from Neo4j to a `.dot` file for visualization using Graphviz.
*   `re_embed_pgvector.py`: Re-embeds all entities in the pgvector database.  Useful after changing the embedding model.

## üéØ Core Innovation

Unlike traditional knowledge graph systems, this implementation follows an agentic approach where the system:

- Autonomously determines what knowledge to expand.
- Maintains contextual awareness across iterations.
- Structures knowledge organically through reasoning.

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

- Check Neo4j browser interface at `http://localhost:7474`
- View logging output in real-time during execution in the console.
- Monitor entity and relationship creation in the console output.
- Examine the generated knowledge graph in Neo4j to verify the accuracy and completeness of the extracted information.
- Monitor pgvector database for embeddings.
